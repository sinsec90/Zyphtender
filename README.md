# Zyphtender
Fanfic challenge suggested by Zyph upon the first time meeting Treetender.

This novel is entirely a work of fiction. The names, characters and incidents portrayed in it are the work of the authorâ€™s imagination. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events or localities is entirely coincidental.

Rules:
=========
* Not too NSFW to comply with ToS
* Don't make either party ***too*** uncomfortable
* Make sure there is plenty of chaos

Help:
=========
* You can use Overleaf to help with editing
* If you don't know how to use that, just sumbit your change request in "Issues"
* If you have more ideas, there is always forks
