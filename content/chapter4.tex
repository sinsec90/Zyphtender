\chapter{Until next time}

\lettrine{D}{estiny} sure had a cruel sense of humor, the moment was \mbox{interrupted} by a buzz from Zyph's pocket, dragging them back to reality from this euphoric experience. As a futile attempt, Tree crossed his arms further, trying to hold onto Zyph for a bit longer. Zyph slid his hands off Tree's back. Tree's fur passing through the gaps between Zyph's finger like the fleeting experience they just shared. Zyph had to leave.

"I...I have to go." Zyph reluctantly admitted.

"It's fine." Tree answered.

"There will be a next time, right?" asked Zyph.

"You are always welcome." Tree answered.

Tree led Zyph by his hand back to the doorway. It was dark outside. The streets were illuminated with the cold harsh street lights. Tree opened the door, revealing the dull washed out colours of the winter outdoors, juxtaposing the vibrant interior set where they just preformed their passionate act.

"So see you next time."  Zyph said his goodbye. His eyes reflecting the warm lighting from Tree's room, glowing like ember in the dark.

"This weekend?" Tree suggested.

Zyph nodded and turned around. Setting off into the snowy night.
