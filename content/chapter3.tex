\chapter{Heating up}

Zyph pushed himself out of the crevice and adjusted himself. "I found the problem," explained Zyph,"the cables have knotted up and was stuck. It is a bit deep but I think I can get it it."

Before Tree could express his gratitude, the nimble wolf flipped over with his back on the floor and gave Tree a smug grin to reassure his confidence. Then pushed himself back into his work place with his strengthen thighs in a two stoke motion. Reaching deeper in the unexplored area of Tree's furniture.

"I think I got it." said Zyph from under the sofa. Zyph attempted to wiggle his legs but they would not budge. "I my thighs have gotten thicker from my recent workout. I think I am stuck." said Zyph, with a mixture of embarrassment and a hint of playfulness.

Trying to offer his help, Tree got on all fours. "I'm going to pull you out, don't worry" said Tree. Tree positioned himself between Zyph's legs and wrapped his hands around Zyphs thighs. Squeezing Zyphs thighs against his knees to get a grip on the trapped wolf. Zyph thighs were hot like a  glowing poker extracted from a fireplace. Underestimated the girth of Zyph's thighs, Tree re-adjusted his grip and gave it a light tug.

"I think you really got yourself stuck there," said Tree, still pulling and shuffling himself side to side, "I'll give you one big pull. Tell me if it hurts."

Like pulling a stubborn tap root from the ground, Tree pulled gently but with strength. Comically dislodging Zyph from the grasp of the gap, losing his balance falling forward. Both reacted this their own ways as if they had rehearsed this situation in their head from seeing all plot required "accidents" in anime. Tree supported his fall with his arms in push up position and Zyph held his hand up to dampen the weight of the falling Tree.

Two fluffs locked into a predicament. Now Zyph was caged within Tree, between his tow arms back against the floor. Muzzles just a few inches apart. Sharing the same air that the air exhaled. Tree attempted to hold in his shock, but his panting motion, moving his chest ever so closer to Zphy's body, had betrayed him. Tree tried his beset to keep himself from crushing such precious bean.

Zyph's hand buried in Tree's chest fluff, feeling Tree's warmth on his bare beans.
