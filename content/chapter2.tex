The grey wolf entered. His chains rattled as like bells ringing, proclaiming their master's entrance. They are attached to a metal collar, loosely fitted around his neck. "You can call me Zyph," said the wolf,"and how can I help you today?" Their voice was low pitched but clear, ending with a sound like a pleasant kind of low pitch hum.

"Call me Tree. I'm experiencing some tracking issue and I can't seem to figure out what's wrong." said Tree, pulling himself out of the transfixing voice of the guest.

Following Tree's lead, Zyph was brought to the play space. Zyph was quick to work, examining the setup. His bright yellow eyes bolting around, scanning the situation he was facing. "I think I found the problem," explained Zyph as he gestured towards the space under the sofa, "I think there is something wrong with the cabling under the sofa."\\
Zyph reached for a pen light from his pocket, switching it on and holding it between his muzzle. Zyph looked at Tree as if he was doing a blep with a metallic tongue glowing in the tip, he muttered, "Ar'll jus tak a lor a et". Tree could not help but let out a little chuckle. Eager to get to the problem, Zyph with another tool in his hand. In a pouncing motion landing his tummy on the floor, Zyph pushed himself under the sofa.

Tree and half a torso of Zyph in the room were engulfed by an awkward silent. In an attempt to break up the still air, Tree asked, "um... So what is you favourite food?"

"My favourite food is broccoli," Zyph answered, "I can go on for hours about why I like it but let's leave that conversation for another time."

Feeling deterred, Tree decided to to have another go at igniting conversation to drive away the cold silence in the room. Tree asked, "Do you have any hobbies? What do you do in your free time?"

"I sing and play the piano and ukulele" Zyphy answered. Despite not seeing Zyph's face, Tree knew he had done it. As evident by Zyphy's tail wagging proudly in the air, like freshly ignited flames from a campfire, dancing along the rhythmic fanning from the fire starter.

Satisfied by his effort, Tree pushed on,"So what songs do you sing?"

"I sing a lot of sad songs and I like sining in piano ballad style." Zyph answered, hardly containing his enthusiasm,"I even did a piano cover for the song x3 Nuzzles."

They both shared a laughter. The awkwardness had been driven away by the roaring flame they just started. They continued. Sharing their interests and their stories, fueling the fire in this cold winder afternoon. Yet unbeknown to both of them, the fire was burning far hotter than either of them could imagine.
