A cute bean is pacing back and forth by the door. Frustrated, Tree muttered, "What's taking them so long. When will they arrive?"

Tree's trackers were broken, enduring once of the worst scenarios one who trapped indoors on a holiday could. Impatient, tree lowered his stature. Dropping his bottom to the ground, knees bent, arms supporting from behind his back. Fully laid on the floor, Tree threw himself a tantrum.

However the universe is impartial, they took no sides and does not care if one fluff is complaining about his circumstances. Little did he know he is about to cross paths with another amazing gem in his life.

Yellow eyes glistened in the dusk. Their grey fur was sprinkled with fresh snow like icing sugar on a pastry. Tufts of white fur forming a fridge running between their pointy ears. Tree answered, "Yes. Come in."
